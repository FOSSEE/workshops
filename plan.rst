Outline and plan for the SciPy2010 tutorial
=============================================

Outline of sessions
----------------------

Standard allocation is about 1 hour per session which fits perfectly
with our requirements.  However, the level of the fossee slides is
rather basic and we need to add more material to it or adjust the
timings suitably.  What we will do is add rough timelines to each session
as we go over the slides and also add more material as we see fit.

  - Session 1: (PR/KD)  
    - Checklist
    - Starting up IPython
    - Odds and ends
    - Introductory Plotting
    - Review problem
    - Command history
    - Python scripts.

  - Session 2: (KD)
    - Plotting Points
    - Lists
    - Simple pendulum
    - Strings
    - Summary

  - Session 3: (CB)
    - Basic statistical calculations
    - Handling larger data (sslc data)
        - Parsing data files
        - Dictionaries
        - Pie chart
        - Arrays for efficiency

  - Session 4: (PR)
    - Basic matrices.
    - Elementary image processing.
    - Add some image processing stuff here.
