Outline and plan for the SciPy2010 tutorial
=============================================

Outline of sessions
----------------------

Standard allocation is about 1 hour per session which fits perfectly
with our requirements.  However, the level of the fossee slides is
rather basic and we need to add more material to it or adjust the
timings suitably.  What we will do is add rough timelines to each session
as we go over the slides and also add more material as we see fit.
